## About

This application is a combination of what I have learned in a 3 months time span and some ideas and features I have been wantong to implement. In general, my goal is to build a base line social media app with an infinite scrollable feed, full CRUD functionality in users and post models.

## Roadblocks and solutions

- To render the most recent post from the back-end, I tried using the reverse method django offers to serve the front end a reversed array of posts, while it worked momentarily it was very inconsistent so I instead used the order_by id method to get an array with the latest posts
